This project is about a website where people can share pictures in an interactive way. This website gives them the opportunity and functionality to create their own profiles and sharing picture posts under that profile like their own digital photo library but only more shareable.

**Technology used**

- Figma
  Figma was used to design the project templates and elements and to source images used in the project .

- Visual Studio
  Visual studio was used to write the code for the project using all the css principles learned so far including, block, flexbox, grid layout and a more streamlined structure of css rules in different files linked to a common folder in root directry.

- Gitbash
  We used gitbash to initialize git files for any changes to be saved in out git repostory and push the code to our online repository.
